// Graph isomorphism is an equivalence relation on graphs and as such it partitions the class of all graphs into equivalence classes

// Do two adjacency lists represent the same graphc


/// Given two graphs, determine if they are in the same equivalence class
/// - Parameters:
///   - graph1: A Graph
///   - grpah2: A Graph
//func areEquivalent(_ graph1: Graph, _ grpah2: Graph) -> Bool {
//
